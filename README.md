Project: Calculator

Description:

This is a basic calculator program I built as a personal learning project while exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It currently performs the following arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

Known Glitches:

- +/- button might not function as expected.
- Entering multiple operators in sequence may lead to incorrect calculations.
- Pressing equal sign multiple times doesn't produce continuous calculations.

Planned Improvements:

- Fix logic for +/- button.
- Implement logic to limit the number of digits allowed for input and the displayed result.
- Handle multiple operators in sequence correctly (e.g., 9 * 9 - should calculate 81).
- Allow for hitting equal sign multiple times to perform continuous calculations based on the last operation.
- Improve variable and function names for better readability.
- Enhance code readability and organization.
- (Optional) Consider design improvements for a more user-friendly interface.

Technologies Used:

1. HTML (Structure)
2. CSS (Styling)
3. JavaScript (Functionality)
